# Setup networking
Start up virtualbox and navigate to File -> Preferences -> Network. Go to 
'Host-only Networks', and add a new network with the default properties:

ipv4 address: 10.0.3.1
ipv4 network mask: 255.255.255.0
ipv6 address: <empty>
ipv6 network mask length: 0

It is up to you if you configure a DHCP server for this network, but it is
preferred to keep it off. If you do enable it, be sure to keep the ip range
from 10 to 20 free for static ip addressing purposes.

# Vagrant workflow
- Bring up virtual machine using:
$ vagrant up <your development hostname>
- Make change to codebase
- Run commands to update vagrant box:
$ vagrant rsync <your development hostname>
$ vagrant provision <your development hostname>
- Test your changes inside vagrant box
- Repeat until satisfied

Once a change is complete, and working inside vagrant, commit to master
